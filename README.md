Smart Dustbin

Aim : Due To Urbanization, There Is A Tremendous 
Increase In Waste Production. For Proper Waste 
Management, The Government Has Installed Dustbins At 
Public Places. You Must Have Noticed That The Dustbins In 
Public Places Aren’t So Clean And Hence People Avoid To 
Open It For Throwing Garbage. Also, Their Lid Cannot Be 
Left Open Or It Will Attract Flies And Cause Infections. 
In Order To Solve This Issue, We Have Designed A ‘Smart 
Dustbin’ Using Arduino Uno, Servo Motor And Ultrasonic 
Sensor. So, It Will Automatically Open Up The Lid Upon The 
Detection Of The Human Hand.
However, This Helps In Maintaining The Environment Clean 
With The Help Of Technology. It Is A Sensor-Based Dustbin 
So It Would Be Easy To Use For Any Age Group. Also, It Is 
Cost-Effective So That Many Numbers Of People Can Get 
The Benefit From It.

Materials :  
1.    Arduino Uno 
2.    Ultrasonic Sensor 
3.    Servo Motor 
4.    Jumper Wires 
5.    Battery 
6.    Dustbin 
7.    Cardboard 
8.    Adhesive 
9.    Scissor 
Software Used: – Arduino IDE

Working principle :- 
Here we Use two ultrasonic sensor one sensor is used for 
detect the  objects and the another one is used for alart 
massage for Human being .If a man throw garbage in front 
of the dustbin the first ultrasonic sensor sencess this 
objects and pass a massage “don’t leteral any where  use 
dustbin.Then the man throw away in the dustbin then the 
second ultrasonic sensor sencess and passing a signal to 
arduino then the Arduino pass the signal to servo 
motor.Then the dustbin open.
